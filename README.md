# My very first website - A project by Danny Kadoshi

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

Welcome to my first website! This website is a project that I am building as part of my journey in learning web development through the Code Institute program. I am just starting to learn about HTML and CSS, so this project is a great opportunity for me to practice my skills and apply what I have learned so far.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple website that showcases my skills as I follow along the video instructions from Code Institute. 

To achieve this, I am using HTML and CSS. HTML is the markup language that I used to structure the content of my website. CSS was used to style the website and make it visually appealing. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS

## Rationale

The rationale behind this project is to provide a practical application for the skills that I am learning through the Code Institute program. By building a website, I will be able to practice the concepts and techniques that I am learning, such as HTML tags and CSS selectors. This project will also allow me to showcase my progress and demonstrate my abilities to potential employers or clients in the future.
